# MIROKAÏ Use Case: Meet and Greet for SoRo-KA

## Project Abstract
This use case outlines an interactive visitor engagement demo designed to enhance the experience about social robots. The MIROKAÏ humanoid robot welcomes and greets visitors upon arrival, creates an inviting first impression, and facilitates courteous distribution of sweets or gifts in a culturally appropriate manner. In parallel, it delivers clear information about KACST—its mission, research domains, innovations, Vision 2030—as well as details about specific exhibitions. The result is a cohesive, welcoming, and informative experience that reflects KACST's commitment to scientific excellence and public outreach.
