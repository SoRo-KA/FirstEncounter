## 🧩 Collaboration Guidelines

To ensure smooth collaboration, please follow these best practices:

1. **Work in branches**  
   - Create a new branch for each feature, update, or use case.  
   - Use clear naming conventions, e.g. `feature/new-use-case`, `fix/script-bug`, etc.

2. **Commit frequently and clearly**  
   - Write meaningful commit messages (e.g. `Add initial use case definition`).

3. **Merge via Merge Requests (MRs)**  
   - Always submit a Merge Request before merging into the main branch.  
   - Request at least one review from another collaborator.

4. **Keep main branch clean**  
   - The `main` branch should always contain stable, tested content.

5. **Document your work**  
   - Add relevant information or usage instructions in a `README.md` within each use case folder.

## 🧠 Purpose

This repository aims to provide a **shared workspace** where the KACST and collaborators can design, develop, and test demo use cases efficiently — ensuring consistency, traceability, and teamwork across all contributions.
